## Game Dev Experience

Most of my game development work has been in Unity3D, though some of my early prototypes were build in native iOS SpriteKit/SceneKit.

### Gravia

Gravia is currently in development as a prototype. It is a 3D first-person game in which the player create black holes to manipulate the environment, solving puzzles and overcoming obstacles.
